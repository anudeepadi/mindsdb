  To follow this guide, please make sure you have a local installation of
  MindsDB. [Here](/setup/self-hosted/pip/source/), you can find out how to
  install MindsDB locally.

## Starting MindsDB with Default Configuration

It is very straightforward to start MindsDB locally with the default config
file - just run the commands below.

First, activate the virtual environment with this command:

```bash
source mindsdb/bin/activate
```

And then, start MindsDB using this command:

```bash
python -m mindsdb
```

Now you can access your MindsDB locally at `127.0.0.1:47334`.

## Starting MindsDB with Extended Configuration

First, you should prepare a `config.json` file based on the following template; remember to substitute the values for your custom configuration.

```json
{
    "permanent_storage": {
        "location": "local"
    },
    "paths": {},
    "log": {
        "level": {
            "console": "INFO",
            "file": "DEBUG",
            "db": "WARNING"
        }
    },
    "debug": false,
    "integrations": {},
    "gui": {
        "autoupdate": true
    },
    "auth":{
        "http_auth_enabled": false,
        "username": "mindsdb",
        "password": "123"
    },
    "api": {
        "http": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "47334"
        },
        "mysql": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "47335",
            "database": "mindsdb",
            "ssl": true
        },
        "mongodb": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": "47336",
            "database": "mindsdb"
        }
    },
    "cache": {
        "type": "local"
    }
}
```

Now that your `config.json` file is ready, run the command below to start
MindsDB locally with your custom configuration.

```bash
python -m mindsdb --config=/path-to-the-extended-config-file/config-file.json
```

You can access your MindsDB locally at `127.0.0.1:47334`, or any other IP
address and port combination if you altered them.

## Enabling Basic Authentication for REST APIs

MindsDB allows you to enable basic authentication for its REST APIs. This adds an extra layer of security to your MindsDB instance. To enable basic authentication:

1. Open your `config.json` file.

2. In the `auth` section, set `http_auth_enabled` to `true` and provide a username and password:

```json
"auth": {
    "http_auth_enabled": true,
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_secure_password"
}
```

3. Save the `config.json` file and restart MindsDB with this configuration.

Once enabled, all HTTP requests to MindsDB's REST APIs will require basic authentication. Clients must include an `Authorization` header with a base64-encoded string of `username:password`.

Example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:47334/api/projects" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'your_username:your_secure_password' | base64)"
```

Remember to replace `your_username` and `your_secure_password` with the credentials you set in the configuration file.

<Warning>
Ensure you use HTTPS in production environments to encrypt credentials during transmission.
</Warning>
